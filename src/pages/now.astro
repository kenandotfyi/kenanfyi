    <p><i>Last updated: 24 Nov 2024</i></p>
    <p>I'm currently trying to publish the articles I wrote already. But in the meantime I am still making updates to the blog design. So the look will probably be very different in the end.</p>

    <p>Some open points about the design:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[x] a proper working dark mode</li>
      <li>[ ] designing a logo</li>
      <li>[x] implementing the sidenotes</li>
      <li>[~] implementing the backlinking algorithm</li>
      <li>[~] fine tuning the layout</li>
      <li>[x] implementing the hover previews</li>
      <li>[x] designing a favicon</li>
      <li>[x] RSS feed</li>
      <li>[x] added last toot feed for every page (experimental)</li>
      <li>[x] content collections such as bits and articles</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</BasePage>
