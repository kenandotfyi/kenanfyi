    Currently I'm trying to publish the articles I wrote already. But in the
    meantime I am still making updates to the blog design. So the look will
    probably be very different in the end.
  </p>

  <p>Some open points about the design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>[ ] a proper working dark mode</li>
    <li>[ ] designing a logo</li>
    <li>[ ] designing a favicon</li>
    <li>[~] implementing the backlinking algorithm</li>
    <li>[~] fine tuning the layout</li>
    <li>[x] RSS feed</li>
    <li>[x] content collections such as bits and articles</li>
  </ul>
</Base>
