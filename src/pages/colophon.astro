    <strong>kenan.fyi</strong> is my personal website, simultaneously serving as
    an experimental tool on web design. I'm building in public and the entire codebase
    is hosted at <a
      href="https://github.com/kenandotfyi/kenanfyi"
      target="_blank">Github > kenan.fyi</a
    >.

    It is built with Astro and mostly static, although there are some
    client-side Javascript for interactivity. There are no ads and no analytics,
    and I don't plan to implement any ads in the future. I may implement an
    article view counter, but that will be the only thing in terms of analytics.
    Other than that, I will never implement some kind of bullshit tracking
    algorithm or anything like that. Blogging should be free of that kind of
    non-sense.

    Typeface I am using is the font bundle comes with <a
      href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a
    >, which is a modification of the IBM Plex. You can find the fonts here: <a
      href="https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts">iA-Fonts</a
