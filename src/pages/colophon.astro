    <strong>kenan.fyi</strong> is my personal website, simultaneously serving as
    an experimental tool on web design. I'm building in public and the entire codebase
    is hosted at
    <a href="https://github.com/kenandotfyi/kenanfyi" target=_blank>Github > kenan.fyi
    </a>

    It is built with Astro and mostly static, although there are some
    client-side Javascript for interactivity. There are no ads and no analytics,
    and I don't plan to implement any ads in the future. I may implement an
    article view counter, but that will be the only thing in terms of analytics.
    Other than that, I will never implement some kind of bullshit tracking
    algorithm or anything like that. Blogging should be free of that kind of
    non-sense.
