    <strong>kenan.fyi</strong> is my personal website, simultaneously serving as
    an experimental tool on web design. I'm building in public and the entire codebase
    is hosted at
    <a href="https://github.com/kenandotfyi/kenanfyi" target=_blank>Github > kenan.fyi
    </a>

    It is built with Astro and mostly static, although there are some
    client-side Javascript for interactivity. There are no ads and no analytics,
    and I don't plan to implement any ads in the future. I may implement an
    article view counter, but that will be the only thing in terms of analytics.
    Other than that, I will never implement some kind of bullshit tracking
    algorithm or anything like that. Blogging should be free of that kind of
    non-sense.

    <s>Typeface I am using for body is the font bundle comes with <a
      href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a
    >, which is a modification of the IBM Plex. You can find the fonts here: <a
      href="https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts">iA-Fonts</a
    >. The headers and dates on the main page are <a
      href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a
    >.</s>
    I have switched to system fonts recently to lower CLS.
