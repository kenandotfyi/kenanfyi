# Browsing/Consuming Stuff

[Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Arc has been my browser of choice on desktop since the beta has been released. I quickly got used to the vertical tabs and other tiny bits of it. Being a Chromium based browser also allows me to use my favorite extensions, such as [Vimium](), [WhatFont](), [Zotero Connector]() and so on.
