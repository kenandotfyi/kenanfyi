# Browsing

[Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Arc is my browser of choice on desktop since the beta has been released. I quickly got used to the vertical tabs and other tiny bits of it. Being a Chromium based browser also allows me to use my favorite extensions, such as [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki), [WhatFont](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm), [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) and so on.

[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/): Vivaldi is another nice Chromium based browser which I currently use at work, since we are on Windows. It is quite customizable, therefore I like to use it as my daily-driver at work.

# Design

This is a little complicated since I also use some software for my work which mainly includes drawing schematics and diagrams for electronic circuits.

[Figma](https://figma.com/): I use Figma since couple of years but I am not an expert of it. Only use-case for me is to quickly sketch some ideas about websites or logos and some typograpy stuff as well as some color palette generating.

[Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/): Monodraw is very interesting Plain Text based art creation tool which lets you virtually draw anything from layouts to flow charts and diagrams. I use it to quickly sketch some connection diagrams since I like the vector output option which I use in couple of places.

[SPlan](https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/elektronik-software/splan-80.html): This is a very old software which lets you draw electronic schematics in a quite straightforward way. What I like about it is the fact that you can create your own library of symbols and use it directly without any hassle of Library Management. Plus it is quite cheap for such well-designed software.

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): Almost 0% of the time I open the Excalidraw website and draw something. My main use case is the [Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) which I extensively use.
