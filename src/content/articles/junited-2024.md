Junited is this simple but excellent idea from [Robert Birming](https://birming.com/junited-blog-love/) and I have noticed it in my RSS feed the other day from [Chris](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/junited-2024/). Lovely idea! Without further ado, I start with my list and will update it during June 2024:
