So, thanks to [Robert](https://birming.com), Junited is back for another year and I'll start right away.
I was actively updating my [bookmarks](/bookmarks/) for a while, but maybe I just post new entries here throughout June. I hope I will finish it with 30 posts this year.
Without further ado:

1. [Writing is Taking a Stab at Immortality](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/05/writing-is-taking-a-stab-at-immortality/) <i class="dim">2025-06-01</i>
2. [Open Source Can't Coordinate](https://matklad.github.io/2025/05/20/open-source-cant-coordinate.html) <i class="dim">2025-06-02</i>
