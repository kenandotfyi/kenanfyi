# Note-taking

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): I use Obsidian as my PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) tool. In fact, I'm writing these sentences in Obsidian right now. Since the beta, I'm completely hooked and will not change to another tool in the near future. My workflow is quite sophisticated and modified to my needs. I will also post quite a lot of stuff about it here in my blog. Besides being an Insider, I am also a Sync user and I highly recommend it.
- [GoodNotes](https://goodnotes.com): Well designed note-taking tool for iPad. I use pretty much only for meeting notes and quick sketches during meetings.

# Browsing

- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Arc is my browser of choice on desktop since the beta has been released. I quickly got used to the vertical tabs and other tiny bits of it. Being a Chromium based browser also allows me to use my favorite extensions, such as [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki), [WhatFont](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm), [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) and so on.

- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/): Vivaldi is another nice Chromium based browser which I currently use at work, since we are on Windows. It is quite customisable, therefore I like to use it as my daily-driver at work.

# Design

This is a little complicated since I also use some software for my work which mainly includes drawing schematics and diagrams for electronic circuits.

- [Figma](https://figma.com/): I use Figma since couple of years but I am not an expert of it. Only use-case for me is to quickly sketch some ideas about websites or logos and some typography stuff as well as some color palette generating.

- [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/): Monodraw is very interesting Plain Text based art creation tool which lets you virtually draw anything from layouts to flow charts and diagrams. I use it to quickly sketch some connection diagrams since I like the vector output option which I use in couple of places.

- [SPlan](https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/elektronik-software/splan-80.html): This is a very old software which lets you draw electronic schematics in a quite straightforward way. What I like about it is the fact that you can create your own library of symbols and use it directly without any hassle of Library Management. Plus it is quite cheap for such well-designed software.

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): Almost 0% of the time I open the Excalidraw website and draw something. My main use case is the [Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) which I extensively use.

# Utility

- [Raycast](https://raycast.com): Alfred on steroids. It was time anyway for Alfred to retire on my Mac, so I'm happy with Raycast since their launch. And they keep delivering constantly!
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/): I recently started using the trackpad and BTT is a must for custom gestures.
- [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/): Making file copy/cut/paste intuitively easier using small boxes as some kind of staging area.
- [Cleanshot X](https://cleanshot.com/): My tool of choice for screenshots. I think I use it, just because it is a well designed and an extensive piece of software. Otherwise there are dozens of screenshot apps out there.
- [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/): One and only reason I use Karabiner is to assign my Caps Lock key as my Hyper Key.

# Coding

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): For obvious reasons. I tried Neovim, WebStorm, Sublime, Brackets, Atom in the past too but VS Code is still the straightforward choice for me because of the extensions. I use a very minimal and distraction-free setup which also reduces opening time.
- [Warp](https://warp.dev): My terminal of choice. I use oh-my-zsh shell together.

# Organisational

- [Zotero](https://zotero.org): Academic reference manager. I use it together with Obsidian, mainly managing papers, application notes and technical documents in an academic sort of way. For bridging to Obsidian, I use the ZotLit plugin which is amazing. I will explain the Zotero-Obsidian combo later in the blog.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): Todo app. I used TickTick for years, but recently switched to Things.
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical): Using the free version and happy about since such a long time.
