I was trying to run a MediaWiki instance on my dummy server and wanted to serve it using the Caddy
this time. Apache and Nginx configurations are fairly straightforward and easy to find, but Caddy
-since it's fairly new- could be difficult if you are trying to do some non-standard stuff. As I
have successfully executed it with the desired configuration, I wanted to document my observations.

Configuration has two parts, one being the standard **Caddyfile** which I really like to work with,
and the other one being **LocalSettings.php**<Sn id="sn-1">This file is generally in the root folder of your mediawiki</Sn>, which is the default setup file for MediaWiki
instances.

Serving a PHP application through Caddy is straightforward, but I wanted to configure my
installation with the so-called ShortURLs. This requires some setup in the Caddyfile:

<Code file="Caddyfile">
```nginx
your.domain{
    @title {
        not file {
            try_files {path} {path}/
            split_path .php
        }
        path_regexp title ^/(.*)$
    }
    rewrite @title /index.php?title={re.title.1}&{query}  // [!code highlight]
    root * /var/www/html/mw #this might be mediawiki for you
    php_fastcgi unix//var/run/php/php-fpm.sock # serving php applications
    file_server
}
```
</Code>

This configuration redirects the ugly MediaWiki URLs to a more structured **/wiki/Main_page** type.
Further explanations are [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL).

After that you need to edit the LocalSettings.php too:

<Code file="LocalSettings.php">

```php
$wgScriptPath = "";
$wgArticlePath = "/wiki/$1"; #for redirecting to
/wiki/ $wgUsePathInfo = true;
```

</Code>

Reload the Caddy config:

<Code file="terminal">

```bash
caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

</Code>

Done.
